"""Build frontend/data/landscape_outlines.json from the canonical MOSAIC
landscape delineations.

Reads MOSAIC_catalog/boundaries/<CODE>.geojson (one Feature per landscape,
EPSG:4326; skips the combined landscapes.geojson) and emits one SVG path
string per code in the locator map's equirectangular projection:

    x = lon + 180
    y = 90 - lat        (rounded to 2 decimals)

All rings of all polygons are concatenated into a single path with M/L/Z
subpaths (render with fill-rule="evenodd" so interior rings read as holes).
Rings are subsampled to at most MAX_RING_POINTS vertices — enough fidelity
for the click-to-zoom view — keeping the JSON well under the ~120 KB budget
for a build-time import. Each outline also carries its PROJECTED bbox
[x0, y0, x1, y1] (computed from the full-resolution geometry) so the map
can letterbox the zoom target without re-parsing the path.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/build_map_outlines.py [path/to/MOSAIC_catalog]

The catalog path defaults to the sibling repo layout used in
MOSAIC_development/ (../../MOSAIC_catalog relative to this repo).
